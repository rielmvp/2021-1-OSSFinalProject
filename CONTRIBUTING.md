If you are interested in this project or in its ropic, you could be involved in it too! You can make contributions by many ways or forms. 

In order to contribute directly to my project, you could:
1) Ask for access to become a blogger/editor on the Complete IT Web Guide and try to propose an idea to expand the website in terms of being a blogger/editor. You can do this by contacting me straightaway through email or by submitting a feature request as an issue, deatiling your willingness to contribute as a blogger/editor for the Complete IT Web Guide site.
2) Observe my repository and check for bugs or errors in any file that might be incorrect. If you are able to find a bug or error, (with much appreication) you could create a bug report as an issue, or with more effort you could fork my repository, fix the bug/issue and submit a pull request with information corresponding to the pull request template.
3) Suggest new features or functions (such as through programming or website tool implementation) that would greatly improve the Complete IT Web Guide. You could do this by simply submitting a feature request as an issue, detailing your ideas and possible implementation, or you could fork my repository and enhance it by adding the features or functions, testing them, and submitting a pull request with information corresponding to the pull request template.

I would very much apprecate any contribution that you can make towards this project in order to better it for others.
Gabriel Manalu,
