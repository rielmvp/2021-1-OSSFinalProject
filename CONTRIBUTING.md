If you are interested in this project or in its ropic, you could be involved in it too! You can make contributions by many ways or forms. 

In order to contribute directly to my project, you could:
1) Ask for access to become a blogger/editor on the Complete IT Web Guide and try to propose an idea to expand the website in terms of being a blogger/editor. If you submit a feature.
