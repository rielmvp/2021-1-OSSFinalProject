# What is Credit Checker and why is it useful?
Credit Checker is a software feature for the Complete IT Web Guide. Why do you need this? No matter whether you are an IT major student or a student of another major, you always want to know whether or not you finished the amount of courses required to graduate and also calculate your final expected GPA.

With this Credit Checker, you can list down the courses in your major, calculate whether or not you have fulfilled the required credits (especially helpful for IT students since we don't technically have any required courses, and get the final weighted GPA.

# Contributions
This is just one of the software features that can be implemented in this Web Guide. As mentioned in the README of the main branch. there is a detailed information in CONTRIBUTING.md. You could definitely contribute by either issuing a feature request or a probable bug report. This would be very helpful.

# How do I get started?
By using firebase as a database and using some tools to enable use of javascript along with html, the base of the code is able to run in this way. My modifications were only concerning the variables and soem display in the website, so I did not change much of the base code. You can see that in index.html ~ course3.html, I was able to put comments to show where I modified the code to fit my project and my intentions.
